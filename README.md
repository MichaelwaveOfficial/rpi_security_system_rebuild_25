# 🏠 RPI Home Security Project

### ⚠️ Work in Progress

This project is currently an ongoing development and currently visible for demonstration purposes only. Further documentation
    will be provided as the project expands and features are implemented.

The aim is to proivde an accessible, customisable home security system leveraging a lower spec Raspberry Pi. This system 
processes motion, tracks detections and annotates them for you whilst giving the user access and control through the Flask 
web server where these captures can be accessed and emailed to your account.

This is a reattempt at what I envision my spin on accessbile home security should be and what it can offer.
